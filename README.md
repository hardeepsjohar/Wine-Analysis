# Wine-Analysis

Analyze 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the   
wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a    
rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

The guiding question is: Which chemical properties influence the quality of   
red wines?
